          Spiritual Value and Foundation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Proverbs 31: 10-30 – who can find a virtuous woman, for her worth is
          far above rubies, she is like the merchant ships, brings foods from
          far, she rises also while is it yet night, and provides food for a
          household. She considers a field and buys it. She stands up for the
          poor and the needy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Titus 2:4-5, The older women likewise, that they be reverent in
          behaviour, not slanders, not given to much wine, teachers of good
          things, that they should admonish the young women to love their
          husbands, to love their children, to be discreet , chaste,
          home-makers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of
          God may not be blasphemed.

            Over the years, I have observed the diminishing of values among
            young girls and young adults in our society.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our young people are pressured to conform to the societal trends,
            not knowing who they are in Christ.
          </li>
          <li>
            Money, sex, alcoholism, fame and social status seems to be the
            center of life for majority of young people.
          </li>
          <li>
            The valuing of marriage and fear of God is slowly fading off, people
            claiming to be educated and civilized while living borrowed western
            lifestyle.

          The society at large, educate a girl and it benefit the nation. An
          African proverb said, It take a village to raise a child. We can shape
          our future and make Namibia a better country if we invest in our young
