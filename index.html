          Researches and psychologists have all agreed that there is musicality
          crisis in many different contexts within the society. The gender
          balance is no-longer balancing especially in the third world
          countries, men are being left out and female headed households are
          increase by day. Continuous negative portrayal of men in the media,
          along with the feminization of men and loss of fatherhood in society,
          has caused confusion and frustration in younger generation males as
          they do not have a specific role model and are less able to define
          their role in society. According to some sociologists, some men are
          experiencing a crisis of identity where they are struggling with the
          professional and personal demands placed on them in society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changes to traditional roles, such as the man being the main
          breadwinner in the family and playing pivotal roles in the workplace
          it is argued have led to a &#39;crisis of masculinity&#39;. Some
          social commentators point to the alarming figures for male suicide as
          one result of this crisis. Another relatively recent concept in the
          area of masculinity and identity is the idea of the &#39;new man&#39;.
          This refers to men who work but also help in the house with childcare
          and housework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some would argue that our society is rapidly becoming a fatherless
          society, or perhaps more accurately, an absentee father society. The
          importance and influence of fathers in families has been in
          significant decline since the Industrial Revolution and is now
          reaching critical proportions. The near-total absence of male role
          models has ripped a hole the size of half the population in many urban
          areas. Across time and cultures, fathers have always been considered
          essential—and not just for their sperm. Indeed, no known society ever
          thought of fathers as potentially unnecessary. Marriage and the
          nuclear family—mother, father, and children—are the most universal
          social institutions in existence. In no society has the birth of
          children out of wedlock been the cultural norm. To the contrary,
          concern for the legitimacy of children is nearly universal.

          far above rubies, she is like the merchant ships, brings foods from
          far, she rises also while is it yet night, and provides food for a
          household. She considers a field and buys it. She stands up for the
          poor and the needy.

          Titus 2:4-5, The older women likewise, that they be reverent in
          behaviour, not slanders, not given to much wine, teachers of good
          things, that they should admonish the young women to love their
          husbands, to love their children, to be discreet , chaste,
          home-makers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of

            I believe that we all have a unique role to play in this world, and
            mine is to inspire, empower, and uplift others. As a public speaker,
            life coach, and mentor, my purpose is to ignite the flames of
            positive change within each person I meet. I've seen the
            transformative power of coaching and the tremendous impact that a
            single conversation can have on someone's life. It's not just about
            words; it's about connecting with individuals on a deep, personal
            level and guiding them towards their full potential. Your
            contribution isn't just financial; it's an investment in the lives I
            touch and the ripples of positivity that will extend far beyond our
            encounter. Together, we can make a difference, one life at a time.
            Your support fuels my mission to spread hope, purpose, and courage
            to those in need. Join me in this journey of empowerment, and let's
            create a brighter future for all.
